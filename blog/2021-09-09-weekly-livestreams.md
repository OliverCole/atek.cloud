In my last project, CTZN, I [live-streamed almost every minute of development](https://ctzn.network/dev-vlog). It was a lot, but it was a really great way to keep people updated and build a connection with the community.

For Atek, I'm going to do a **weekly livestream every Friday at 2PM CST** ([time zone converter](https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter?t=12pm&tz2=San-Francisco-California)).
We'll do an overview of what's happened in the last week, I'll answer questions, and then (depending on what's going on) we'll do some live coding.

Hope to see you there!
