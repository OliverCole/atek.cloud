# Getting started

:::caution
  **Atek is still in early development.**
  Until Atek reaches v1, users should beware of breaking changes which may not be backwards compatible.
  Atek is available now as a developer preview.
:::

You can install Atek using NPM. You will need to install NodeJS 14+.

```
npm install -g @atek-cloud/atek
```

From there, just run `atek` to start it. Once it has started, you can access it at `http://localhost`. Atek will run on port 80 by default. You can change the port by [editing your config file](/docs/reference/config) or passing the [-p flag](/docs/reference/cli).

If you run into any problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/atek-cloud/atek/issues).
